I’ve been building a lightweight AI-powered Interview Prep Tool designed specifically for aspiring and practicing Product Managers who want to level up their preparation.

🎯 **Who is this for?**

Freshers aspiring to enter product management.

Professionals preparing for PM/Sr. PM/Director-level interviews.

Anyone who wants structured feedback on resumes or interview answers without relying on expensive coaching.

💡 **What does it solve?**

Our tool is built with three simple but impactful use cases:
1️. Resume Module → Upload your Job Description + Resume → get an ATS score, missing skills/keywords, phrasing/formatting suggestions, and benchmarking vs successful PM resumes.
2. Interview Prep Module → Input a question, practice your answer, get AI feedback with role-level scoring, and also see ideal answers/frameworks across levels (Fresher → Director).
3. Mock Interview (Lite) → Chat with an AI interviewer that asks follow-ups like in real interviews, and get a performance report (positives + improvement areas).

🌍 **Why I built this?**
I’ve been fortunate in my career, and I want to give back to the community. Preparing for PM interviews can be stressful, expensive, and often inaccessible.
So I’ve open-sourced the app + codebase so anyone can use, improve, and build on top of it.
